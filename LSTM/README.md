## 🧠 What is LSTM?

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) designed to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data. Unlike traditional RNNs, LSTMs can effectively learn from long sequences without suffering from the vanishing gradient problem. They are widely used in applications such as:

- 📈 Time series forecasting
- 💬 Natural language processing (e.g., sentiment analysis, machine translation)
- 🎙️ Speech recognition
- 🛡️ Anomaly detection
