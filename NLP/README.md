# Sequence Prediction using LSTM Networks
(Assignment 4: Implementing and Analyzing LSTM Models*)

---

## Objective
This project explores the application of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for sequence prediction tasks. The goal is to understand LSTM internals, train models for text or sequence generation, and evaluate their performance based on predictive accuracy and qualitative output.
